		You didn't actually see Tuco? You got this money from Tuco? Tuco gave you this is what you're saying? You made a
		deal? How... why would you make a deal with that scumbag? You see what he did to me? No way man, okay, no
		understanding! Without even talking to me, you told this... insane ass-clown, dead-eyed killer, that uh... that we 
		would give him two pounds a week?

	<p>
		Don't talk to me about hours, what about sudo, man? How are we gonna get that? You think the meth fairy is gonna 
		just bring it to us? God it takes me a week to get this stuff. I'm driving all the way up to Las Cruces, two 
		hundred miles each way to meet up with my Smurfs. The dudes who go to the drug stores and get a couple boxes at a 
		time and then sell 'em to me. And that's maybe only good for, like a half pound worth. See that's the bottle neck 
		in your brilliant business plan. Of course you would've known that if you would've just asked me.

		Oh c'mon, this is bullshit! I mean look at this dude, alright? He doesn't even know what planet he's living on! 
		You ever, have like a wild animal trapped in your house? Opossum - big, freaky, lookin' bitch. Hey, since when did 
		they change it to opossum? What's up with that? When I was comin' up it was just possum. Opossum makes it sound 
		like he's Irish or something. Why do they gotta go changing everything?

		Don't you get it? On the outside it's a nail salon right, on the inside it's the best money laundering a growing 
		boy could ask for. Wait, wait! Come back here. Sit. Come on, come on... humor me here for a second. You know you 
		need to launder your money, right? Do you understand the basics of it - placement, layering, integration. Well, 
		you wanna stay out of jail don't ya? You wanna keep your money and your freedom. Cause I got three little letters 
		for ya, I - R - S. If they can get Capone, they can get you.

		Hey look, here's you right - pink... Pinkman, get it? Here's your cash. You're out on the town, yeah you're 
		partying hardy, you're knocking boots with the chicky babes and aww! Who's this? It's the tax man and he's looking 
		at you. And what does he see? He sees a young fella, big fancy house, unlimited cash supply and no job. Now what 
		is the conclusion the tax man makes? Aaaaannnt! Wrong! Millions times worse - you're a tax cheat. What do they do? 
		They take every penny and you go in the can for felony tax evasion. Ouch! What was your mistake? You didn't 
		launder your money! Now, you give me your money, okay that's called placement. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Hand me that little thing, bin. This is the nail salon, right. I take your dirty money and I slip it into the 
		salon's nice clean cash flow - that's called layering. Final step - integration. The revenues from the salon go to 
		the owner - that's you! Your filthy drug money has been transformed into nice clean taxable income brought to you 
		by a savvy investment in a thriving business. Yeah and if you wanna stay a criminal and not become say a convict, 
		then maybe you should grow up and listen to your lawyer.
